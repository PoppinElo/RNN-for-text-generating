# RNN-for-text-generating
In this repository is stored a code of a recursive neural network to learn of a text and to be able to generate one of the same type.

Made in Python

My references are:
-The Karpathy's rnn code for shaskespeare text generating
-http://www.deeplearningbook.org/contents/rnn.html for understanding the equations
